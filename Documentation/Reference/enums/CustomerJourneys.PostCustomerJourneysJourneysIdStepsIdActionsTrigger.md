Customer Journeys API trigger for a contact

A step trigger in a Customer Journey. To use it, create a starting point or step from the Customer Journey builder in the app using the Customer Journeys API condition. We’ll provide a url during the process that includes the {journey_id} and {step_id}. You’ll then be able to use this endpoint to trigger the condition for the posted contact.
